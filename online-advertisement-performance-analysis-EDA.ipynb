The core objective is to develop and implement a robust analytical framework for a third-party consulting firm that manages advertising campaigns for various client companies. The primary goal of this research is to leverage advanced data analysis techniques to maximize the client's return on advertising spend (ROAS) and enhance the overall cost-efficiency of their campaigns. The complexity of this task is driven by the sheer volume and high-dimensional nature of the campaign data, which includes a vast array of metrics and user engagement signals. This data complexity renders traditional business intelligence tools, such as spreadsheet software, insufficient for deriving actionable insights and necessitates the application of machine learning and statistical modeling to uncover meaningful patterns and predictive capabilities.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Data Dictionary","metadata":{"id":"9jeC5BZ-GmNc"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The data that my company has is the previous data with previous campaigns until present (assume), which customer companies hired my company to do an online advertisement for them.

This approach is designed to maintain the integrity of the data's original distribution, thereby minimizing bias in subsequent analyses.\n\nThe chosen methodology for handling missing numerical data is based on the principle of skewness. Skewness, a measure of the asymmetry of a probability distribution, indicates whether the data is concentrated to one side of the mean. . For distributions with low skewness, where the data is relatively symmetrical, the mean is an appropriate measure of central tendency. However, for highly skewed distributions, the mean can be disproportionately influenced by outliers, making the median a more robust and representative measure.\n\nDrawing inspiration from established data science practices and similar case studies, such as the methodology outlined in the SuperMario's Notebook on Kaggle, the following rule-based imputation plan will be implemented:\n\n- For any numerical column with a skewness value S such that ∣S∣<1, missing values will be imputed with the mean of the existing data in that column.\n\n- For any numerical column with a skewness value S such that ∣S∣≥1, missing values will be imputed with the median of the existing data in that column.\n\nThis approach ensures that the imputed values are statistically representative of their respective distributions, mitigating the risk of introducing significant artifacts into the dataset. The decision to use the mean for low-skewness data preserves the overall average of the distribution, while the use of the median for high-skewness data prevents a few extreme values from distorting the central tendency of the feature.","metadata":{"id":"9H52lriSA5zB"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Checking skewness of numerical column by using for-loop, .skew, and histogram before filling

While alternative time-series methods like forward or backward filling were considered, they were determined to be unsuitable as they would artificially shift the temporal values and misrepresent the actual data distribution.","metadata":{"id":"dSHTAGps-vup"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df","metadata":{"id":"wfJ54kqH-1aI","outputId":"7840380c-44ea-493f-8292-e033dbd61cb1","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-25T21:47:08.434798Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-25T21:47:08.435196Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-25T21:47:08.458605Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-08-25T21:47:08.435170Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-25T21:47:08.457536Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Copy DataFrame to sort and see the distribution of date after sorting.","metadata":{"id":"dnnU6f418Ip5"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_date_sorted = df.copy()                                                      # Copy DataFrame for prepared to see the distribution of data","metadata":{"id":"HrH1uMfCR8mM","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-25T21:47:08.459723Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-25T21:47:08.460075Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-25T21:47:08.595957Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-08-25T21:47:08.460047Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-25T21:47:08.594843Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Sort values in Date column from the smallest value to biggest value (ascending)","metadata":{"id":"ch1trk-S8Lgi"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_date_sorted = df_date_sorted.sort_values(by='Date')","metadata":{"id":"cTo-Y-JWR3q3","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-25T21:47:08.597139Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-25T21:47:08.597463Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-25T21:47:08.724611Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-08-25T21:47:08.597437Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-25T21:47:08.723716Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Display the table to check data after sorting","metadata":{"id":"nu2lJeMs_UcF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_date_sorted","metadata":{"id":"IbqYpP_QSFij","outputId":"652a9bff-80ce-4be7-c880-fd025434d0ee","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-25T21:47:08.725743Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-25T21:47:08.726123Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-25T21:47:08.746996Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-08-25T21:47:08.726099Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-25T21:47:08.745960Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"After sorting the values in the date column, a histogram was plotted to visualize the distribution of the data prior to the imputation of missing values.","metadata":{"id":"RnDZVbnhAQyj"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(15, 6))\nsns.histplot(data=df_date_sorted['Date'], bins='auto', color = 'lightskyblue')","metadata":{"id":"hLnvtbzvTDGr","outputId":"e27fb5f5-b72f-4239-b4ac-67457baf0f10","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-25T21:47:08.748127Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-25T21:47:08.748908Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-25T21:47:10.747953Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-08-25T21:47:08.748875Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-25T21:47:10.746933Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Check the proportion of values in the column before filling the missing values, which assign date of each row as unique values of the column.","metadata":{"id":"i2fH0aBlAnW1"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"value_counts = df.Date.value_counts(normalize=True).mul(100).astype(str) + '%'                # Count number of unique values -> change them into proportion -> multiply 100 to change into percentage\ndf_value_counts = pd.DataFrame(value_counts)                                                  # Create DataFrame from value above\nsorted_df_DateB = df_value_counts.sort_values(by='proportion', ascending=False)               # Sort value from DataFrame above order by proportion in column from smallest to biggest\nsorted_df_DateB                                                                               # Display sorted DataFrame above","metadata":{"id":"fX0Pqc-5_OMe","outputId":"5c56dcd0-cc3a-4b4f-80bd-dfdad1f5f64d","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-25T21:47:10.749096Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-25T21:47:10.750057Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-25T21:47:10.768355Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-08-25T21:47:10.750028Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-25T21:47:10.767442Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The following two cells contain the code drafted for two separate tasks.

For example, a single customer company, such as Aura Align, consistently aligns with a specific product category, like health. This observed relationship provided a reliable basis for a conditional imputation strategy.\n\nTo implement this, a separate reference DataFrame was created, containing only the non-missing pairs of Customer_Segment and Customer_company values. Duplicate entries were then removed to establish a clean, one-to-one mapping. This reference table was subsequently used to systematically fill the missing company names by performing a lookup based on their corresponding product categories in the Customer_Segment column.

The following sections detail key findings categorized by the strength and direction of the correlations, providing insights into the dataset's underlying dynamics.\n\n**Strong Positive Correlations**\n\nSeveral variables exhibit a strong positive correlation, indicating a clear and predictable relationship between them:\n\n- Duration and Acquisition Cost: A strong positive correlation between the duration of an advertisement and its acquisition cost is a logical and expected finding. It implies that campaigns with longer run times are associated with higher overall expenses.\n\n- Duration with Clicks and Impressions: The duration of a campaign also shows a strong positive correlation with both Clicks and Impressions. This is intuitive, as a longer campaign duration provides more opportunities for an advertisement to be seen and clicked on by the target audience.\n\n- Acquisition Cost with Clicks and Impressions: A strong positive relationship is observed between Acquisition_Cost and both Clicks and Impressions. This correlation highlights that a higher investment in advertising directly translates to increased visibility and user interaction, as measured by these metrics.\n\n- Clicks and Impressions: The most significant correlation exists between Clicks and Impressions. This is a foundational relationship in digital marketing, as a click on an advertisement is contingent upon an initial impression. A lack of this strong correlation would signal a major inefficiency in the marketing strategy, such as a low click-through rate.\n\n**Moderate and Low Correlations**\n\nThe analysis also revealed several moderate and low correlations, suggesting more nuanced relationships:\n\n- ROI and Engagement Score: A moderate correlation between ROI and Engagement_Score indicates that while increased user engagement is beneficial, it does not consistently translate to a significant increase in sales. This is likely influenced by campaigns with non-revenue-generating goals, such as Brand Awareness or Product Launch, which prioritize engagement over immediate financial returns.\n\n- Clicks/Impressions and Engagement Score: The low correlation between Clicks/Impressions and Engagement_Score suggests that a large number of views and clicks are not resulting in deep user engagement with the advertised content. This could point to a need to refine the advertisement content to be more captivating.\n\n- Clicks/Impressions and ROI: A low correlation between Clicks/Impressions and ROI implies that high traffic volume does not directly equate to high profitability. This is a crucial finding that reinforces the idea that some campaign goals are not designed for direct income generation.\n\n**No-correlation and Inverse Correlations**\n\nSeveral features showed very weak or negative correlations, providing insights into potential inefficiencies:\n\n- Language and Target Audience: The negligible correlation between the language used in the advertisements and the target audience suggests a potential misalignment. It could indicate that the language choice is not a primary factor in audience targeting or that it is not optimized to resonate with the viewers.\n\n- Date and Channel Used: A near-zero correlation between Date and Channel_Used confirms that campaigns are not run on a seasonal or time-based schedule on specific platforms, allowing for year-round advertising flexibility.\n\n- Impressions/Clicks and Customer Segment: The lack of a clear correlation between Impressions/Clicks and Customer_Segment is an expected outcome given the aggregated nature of the data. To analyze this relationship effectively, a segmented analysis for each product category would be required.\n\n- Inverse Correlations: The presence of inverse or negative correlations, particularly those involving ROI and other metrics, is a significant finding. This suggests that certain platforms (Channel_Used), high traffic volume (Clicks and Impressions), and even language choices may be poorly suited for certain product categories, leading to a negative ROI. This points to a major inefficiency in the marketing strategy that warrants further investigation.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Initial attempts to visualize feature correlations using scatter plots proved ineffective due to the specific characteristics of the dataset.

For each platform, the sum of Impressions, Acquisition_Cost, Clicks, and Increase_Sales will be calculated. The total values for these metrics will then be computed across all platforms. By subtracting the values associated with the Pinterest channel from these totals, a clear picture of the potential savings in advertising costs and the corresponding losses in revenue, impressions, and clicks will be established.

These foundational stages were crucial for preparing the dataset and uncovering its underlying structure. The insights gained from this preliminary work directly informed the development of six business questions, each designed to help the company improve the performance of its online advertising campaigns, increase profitability, and reduce advertising costs.\n\nA key finding from the analysis is that while online advertising campaigns are achieving a high number of impressions, the corresponding number of clicks remains consistently low. This suggests a significant disconnect between audience reach and customer engagement. The data indicates that potential customers are seeing the advertisements but are not being compelled to interact with them. This points to a critical area for improvement, such as optimizing ad design, refining messaging, or adjusting the language of the ads to better resonate with the target audience.\n\nThe analysis provides a data-driven basis for making strategic decisions. It recommends actionable steps to enhance marketing effectiveness, from pinpointing underperforming platforms to optimizing creative content. The insights derived from this project will enable the company to make more informed decisions, ultimately leading to higher returns on investment and more efficient use of its advertising budget.","metadata":{"id":"ygd-x7poW7ti"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Final Discussion","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**A final discussion :**","metadata":{"id":"e6c2cdee-22d0-488b-bd2b-346bcad22541"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Limitations of the Dataset**\n\nA significant limitation of this dataset is the presence of numerous categorical columns with non-uniform proportions. For example, the ROI column contains single-digit values, while other metrics like impressions are composed of multiple digits. This wide discrepancy in scale makes it challenging to accurately compute correlation values and create effective visualizations. The lack of a clear, linear relationship between many of the categorical and numerical variables, compounded by a uniform distribution in many instances, further complicates the process of finding meaningful correlations and drawing definitive conclusions.\n\n**Strengths of the Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA)**\n\nDespite these limitations, the explanatory data analysis (EDA) demonstrated several key strengths. The analysis began with a robust process for handling missing categorical values, which were prevalent across many columns. It successfully uncovered hidden information that proved essential for the final analysis. Furthermore, the analysis effectively identified and interpreted correlations between various data types, despite the challenges posed by their non-uniform distributions.\n\nThe business questions section of the report also represents a significant strength. Each question was thoroughly investigated to not only provide a direct answer but also to identify the underlying root causes of the observed trends. The findings were presented with real-world business context, providing actionable recommendations and insightful visualizations for each question.\n\n**Insights and Business Implications**\nThe insights derived from this analysis provide a clear path for business improvement. For instance, the final business question demonstrated how discontinuing advertising on an underperforming platform like Pinterest could significantly reduce costs and enable companies to focus their advertising efforts on more effective channels. The analysis highlighted that ROI could be improved by focusing on platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, where companies can expect a return on advertising costs of 3 to 8 times their initial investment. The analysis also provided detailed information on which platforms are most effective for reaching a large number of viewers for specific campaign goals.\n\n**Data-Driven Recommendations**\nBased on the findings, it is highly recommended that the client company enhances its data collection process by adding more detailed features. These should include metrics such as the average sales cycle for each campaign, the amount of sales per advertisement, and the number of units sold for each advertisement. This information is crucial for a more granular and accurate marketing analysis. Additionally, it is recommended that customer companies re-evaluate their engagement score calculations, as the current scores appear to be unrelated to the observed impressions, clicks, and ROI.","metadata":{"id":"X4NgcVPzcUUR"}}]}
